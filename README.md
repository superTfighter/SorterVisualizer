# Sorter Visualizer

This application helps you visualise different sorting algoritms. It generates a random set of data, then executes the choosen algorithm. 
An SFML frontend helps you to see the whole process.

I created it because I like the way they look, wanted some execise and to help others understand these algorithms. 

## Currently supported algorithms
- Selection sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort

## Dependencies
- The application was built with gcc on linux. (might work on other OS too.)
- SFML for window management
- pthread

## TODO
- Buttons to choose algorithm
- "Slow down" algorithms to show full effect
- Dynamic dataset size (currently operates on fixed size) 
- Finish up all the sorting algorithms
